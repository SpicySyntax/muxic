Zig Audio Recording Desktop App
A basic desktop application built with Zig that provides a GUI button to record audio from the microphone.

User Review Required
IMPORTANT

This implementation uses Capy UI for the GUI framework and miniaudio (via zig-miniaudio/zaudio) for audio recording. These are experimental/developing libraries in the Zig ecosystem.

Alternative approaches:

Use GTK bindings directly for more mature GUI support
Use a simpler CLI-based recorder instead of GUI
Use different audio library (libsoundio)
Please confirm if this approach works for you, or if you'd prefer a different stack.

Proposed Changes
Project Structure
Creating a new Zig project in the d:\code\muxic directory with the following structure:

muxic/
├── build.zig          # Build configuration
├── build.zig.zon      # Dependencies manifest
├── src/
│   └── main.zig       # Main application code
└── README.md          # Project documentation (existing)
Core Files
[NEW] 
build.zig.zon
Zig package manifest defining dependencies:

Capy UI for cross-platform GUI
zaudio (zig-miniaudio) for audio recording
[NEW] 
build.zig
Build configuration that:

Sets up the executable target
Links Capy UI and zaudio dependencies
Configures Windows-specific settings (if needed)
[NEW] 
src/main.zig
Main application implementing:

Capy UI window initialization
Record button with click handler
Audio device initialization using miniaudio
Recording state management (idle/recording)
Audio capture to WAV file
Error handling and cleanup
Implementation Details
GUI Components:

Main window (400x300px)
Record button (toggles between "Start Recording" and "Stop Recording")
Status label showing current state
Simple vertical layout
Audio Recording:

Initialize miniaudio device for capture
Start/stop recording on button click
Save to recording.wav in the current directory
Handle microphone permissions (OS-dependent)
Verification Plan
Automated Tests
# Build the project
zig build
# Run the application
zig build run
Manual Verification
Click "Start Recording" button
Speak into microphone
Click "Stop Recording" button
Verify recording.wav file is created
Play the audio file to confirm recording worked
Test multiple record sessions
Expected Behavior
Application window opens successfully
Button responds to clicks
Status updates appropriately
Audio file is created and contains recorded audio
Application handles errors gracefully (no microphone, permissions denied, etc.)
